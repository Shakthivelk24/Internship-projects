# Full-Stack Development Project  
## Authentication System

## Introduction  
This project is a complete authentication system that includes user signup, login, profile management, and token refresh functionality. The frontend is built using React, while the backend uses Node.js with Express and MongoDB for data storage.

## Project Objectives  
- Create React forms for user signup and login  
- Build backend APIs using JWT and refresh tokens  
- Implement password hashing using bcrypt  
- Secure protected routes on both frontend and backend  
- Develop a user profile dashboard  

## Expected Deliverables  
- Frontend authentication user interface  
- Backend authentication APIs  
- User database schema  

## Evaluation Criteria  
- Proper integration between frontend and backend  
- Secure implementation of JWT and refresh tokens  
- Passwords stored in hashed format  

## Tech Stack  
- React
